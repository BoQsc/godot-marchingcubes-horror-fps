Note on Tree Physics:
Converting all tree instances from StaticBody3D to CharacterBody3D (to enable dynamic falling behavior due to gravity) has been identified as a potentially performance-heavy operation. For now, trees (specifically those using Tree.tscn as a StaticBody3D) will remain static and will not respond to gravity or take damage when shot. They may appear to "float" if the terrain beneath them is modified.
This decision prioritizes current performance considerations.
